## Features
- uses a notch filter for the FIR and IIR Filters
- adds loud high frequency noise
- IIR r value change 
## Requirements
1. Where and how the project objectives were achieved
2. Where and how course topics (discrete signals, discrete systems, frequency domain analyses, FIR filters, IIR filters) were used in the MATLAB files/codes
3. Demonstration of the use from start to end, including various walkthroughs
## TODO LIST
- Add the Description with Information about the Noise etc
## Requirements
- do not go beyond 30 pages
- Time Domain
- Frequency Domain
- T.D. / F.D. analysis
- FIR filters
- IIR filters
